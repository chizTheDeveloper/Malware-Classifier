* Malware Detection Model
This repository contains code for building a malware detection model using machine learning techniques. The notebook Malware_V3_Final_Model.ipynb demonstrates the entire process from data loading to model evaluation. Below is a summary of the steps performed in the notebook.

*Steps
**1. Load Data
The data is loaded from a CSV file containing information about malware samples.

**2. Data Exploration
Basic exploration of the dataset is performed to understand its structure and identify any missing values or duplicates.

3. Graphs
Graphical analysis is conducted to visualize certain features and their relationship with malware detections.

4. Data Cleaning
Missing values and irrelevant columns are handled to prepare the data for modeling. Columns with a high percentage of missing values are removed, and missing values in categorical columns are imputed with the mode, while missing numeric values are replaced with the median.

5. Feature Engineering
New features are created and existing ones are modified to enhance the predictive power of the model.

6. Label Encoding
Categorical columns are encoded using label encoding to convert them into numerical format.

7. Outlier Detection
Outliers in the dataset are detected and handled using Winsorization techniques.

8. Feature Selection
Feature selection is performed to identify the most important features for predicting malware detections.

9. Model Testing and Evaluation
Several machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM are trained and evaluated using different sets of features. The models are tested on both the original and cleaned datasets, and their performance metrics such as accuracy and classification reports are presented.

10. Model Serialization
The best performing model (XGBoost) is serialized and saved to a file (xgb_classifier_model.pkl) for future use.

Dependencies
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
xgboost
lightgbm
Usage
You can run the notebook Malware_V3_Final_Model.ipynb in a Jupyter environment or any other compatible platform to reproduce the analysis and train your own malware detection model.
